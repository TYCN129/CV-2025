# High-Quality and Controllable Image Generation  

This repository contains our **course project** on building **high-quality, controllable image generation models**.  
We integrate **contrastive learning into VAEs** and implement **Conditional GANs** to improve latent space disentanglement, feature-level control, and overall generation quality.

## **Project Overview**
- **Team size:** 4 members  
- **My contributions:**  
  - **Surveyed** GAN, Conditional GAN, and ContraGAN literature.  
  - **Implemented** Contrastive VAE with contrastive loss based on [ContraGAN]: https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.12681 for latent disentanglement.  
  - **Developed** [Conditional GAN][https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.1784] for class-controlled image generation on MNIST.
